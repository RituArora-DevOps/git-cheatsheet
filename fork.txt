for non-members, collaborators and people not part of their projects

fork the repository (not owned by the user), add your changes in the forked repository on your local machine and
then raise a pull request to pull your changes to the actual remote repository to provide your contribution 
Then the actual owner of the repository will review the changes you made to accept or not and give feedback to you.

In this way you can contribute to an open-source project
