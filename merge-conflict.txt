Max and Sarah have been contributing stories. And they are available on the remote repository.

Max's local repository has all the latest changes from the remote and is in sync with it. Check it out!

During a meeting the team decides to add an Index file to the repository named story-index.txt which would contain a list of all stories written.

It wasn't clear who would own this task, so Max decides to do it himself üí™ . He creates a file named story-index.txt and adds a list of stories to it. Check it out under the /home/max/story-blog directory.

Let's now stage and commit the story-index.txt file.

Use the message - Add index of stories

Looks like someone has pushed changes to the remote that needs to be pulled first, before we can push any of our own changes to remote.

Pull the remote changes.

We are now in a merge conflict üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ! Looks like there was already a file named story-index.txt on remote. Someone beat us to it! Let's find out who.

Check the log of the origin/master branch to see what was the last commit on the repository and identify who added the story-index.txt file.

Looks like Sarah already pushed a version of the file. When we pulled latest changes, git tried to merge Max's and Sarah's versions of the story-index.txt file, but was unsuccessful. However the local story-index.txt file is updated with changes from both Max and Sarah to allow you to merge manually.


Inspect the file (use vi editor or just cat story-index.txt) and select the most appropriate statement below. The first section shows Max's data and the second section shows Sarah's data.

cat story-index.txt 
<<<<<<< HEAD
1. The Lion and the Mooose
2. The Frogs and the Ox
3. The Fox and the Grapes
4. The Donkey and the Dog
=======
1. The Lion and the Mouse
2. The Frogs and the Ox
3. The Fox and the Grapes
>>>>>>> f5f88e68ad735230bc0013335b626eed54bdfde2

Looks like both of them were partially wrong. Let's fix the file to remove the errors done by each of them. Let's manually merge changes from both users.

Update the contents of the file (use vi editor) to keep the correct version of the Lion and Mouse story and keep the Donkey and Dog story as well. Remove all the extra lines added by GIT
